 personally don't like MJ, only because it only works on Discord and I don't like Discord (call me old fashioned). Also, I like to have control over my images, especially because I'm using them for “work” 

I have tested a bunch of open-source AI Text-To-Image generators, all based on Stable Diffusion. I will throw here a list of them and I promise an article for next week.

 

Foocus - https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus - Runs on top of Stable Diffusion. Has a pretty simple (Focus) interface and delivers good images. SDXL compatible.
Foocus-MRE - https://github.com/MoonRide303/Fooocus-MRE - A better fork of Foocus. 
InvokeAI - https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI - Beautifull interface, simple to use. One of my favorites
Automatic 1111 - https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui - The CLASSIC Stable Diffusion web interface. The UI can be intimidating at the beginning, but after you get used to it, it is the TO-GO choice if you want to have control. Lots of plugins available. 
Easy Diffusion - https://easydiffusion.github.io/ - Beautiful interface, simple and easy to use. I really like it. Was my entry-point in the AI Text-to-Image generators.
SDNext - https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic - It's a fork of A1111 with better UI.
Makeayo - https://makeayo.com/ - SD for Windows. Easy to install, easy to use. 
 

If you are on Windows, here are two of the best and easy one-click installers for various Text-To-Image systems. 

Stability Matrix - https://lykos.ai/
Pinokio - https://pinokio.computer/

Automatic 1111 - https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
Easy Diffusion - https://easydiffusion.github.io/
